This output format is also an input format. For example, you can create a new dictionary with three items:
>>> eng2sp = {'one': 'uno', 'two': 'dos', 'three': 'tres'} But if you print eng2sp, you might be surprised:

>>> print eng2sp
{'one': 'uno', 'three': 'tres', 'two': 'dos'}

The order of the key-value pairs is not the same. In fact, if you type the same example on your computer, you might get 
a different result. In general, the order of items in a dictionary is unpredictable.

But thatâ€™s not a problem because the elements of a dictionary are never indexed with integer indices. 
Instead, you use the keys to look up the corresponding values:
